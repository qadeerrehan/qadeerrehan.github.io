<div style="clear:both"></div></div></div><span class="textstyle3"><br/>BCB president Nazmul Hasan has said that the board would rather have Shakib Al Hasan operated on his finger during the Zimbabwe series than during the Asia Cup. The statement comes hours after Shakib said that he is contemplating skipping the Asia Cup and getting the operation done for the finger injury he sustained during the tri-nation series in January.<br/><br/>''Shakib called me [from West Indies] and informed me that he needed operation. The head coach also called me and mentioned that it is necessary because he is not getting the strength that is required for batting. If that is the case, he will go for a six-week break,'' Nazmul told reporters after the meeting on Thursday (August 9).<br/><br/>''It is difficult to get such a long break. First we planned whether we can do it in between a series but as that is not the case, he needs to skip a tournament or a series. But we cannot think of playing without him,'' Nazmul said. &quot;He can be operated before the Asia Cup or after the Asia Cup or during the series against Zimbabwe.&quot;<br/><br/>Nazmul had a long session with the new head coach Steve Rhodes along with some of his directors to know their views on player performance as well as the areas that need to be addressed for developing the team to reap success in the upcoming days.<br/><br/>''Today, during our meeting with the coach, he insisted that it [Shakib's operation] should be completed during the Asia Cup. We suggested that it would be better if we operate him during the series against Zimbabwe as we can also take the opportunity to try out few new faces during that time,'' Nazmul said. ''I think that will be the best thing to do. The Asia Cup is expected to be tough tournament and during that time if a player of Shakib's stature doesn't play, chances are high that the morale of the team might go down.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I will talk with Shakib today or tomorrow regarding it. But I prefer if it is done at some other time [instead of during Asia Cup],'' Nazmul concluded.<br/><br/>BCB are insistent because they believe Shakib's absence can be costly considering the level of intensity expected in the Asia Cup, where Bangladesh have been drawn in Pool B with Sri Lanka and Afghanistan in the tournament scheduled from September 15 to 28.<br/><br/>The all-rounder sustained an injury on his left hand during the tri-series final, involving Zimbabwe, against Sri Lanka in January and was forced to leave the field mid-way, and could not take any further part in the final. He also missed the following two-match Test series and two T20Is against Sri Lanka before joining the squad halfway through the Nidahas Trophy in March.<br/><br/>Shakib, who hurt the base of his little finger in the left hand, had to take pain killers to participate in the Windies T20I series to ease the discomfort caused by the injury. His injury was being managed through conservative treatment and rehabilitation, but during this time frame he has had to take anti-inflammatory injections as it went beyond control. He also had a similar injection during his healing period and at that time the physicians in Australia advised him to undergo surgery for complete recovery from the injury.</span>  </div>
