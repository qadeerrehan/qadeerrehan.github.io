</div></div><div id="container_2aa230e3"><div id="container_2aa230e3_padding" ><div class="textstyle2">  <span class="textstyle4">Grant Bradburn, the former New Zealand player, has joined the Pakistan coaching staff as their new fielding coach, the PCB confirmed on Thursday (September 6). Bradburn, who served as Scotland's head coach for over four years, had recently expressed interest in becoming New Zealand's new head coach before the PCB swooped in to sign him on a three-year contract. The 52-year-old will join the Pakistan squad in UAE for the 2018 Asia Cup.<br/><br/>After being named as Scotland's coach in April, Bradburn was credited for the team's improved performances in recent times including a first-ever win at a major ICC event when they beat Hong Kong in a group game of the 2016 World T20. In the last two years, they have registered four wins against four different full member teams, including the thrilling five-run victory against England. Bradburn's side also almost made it to the 2019 World Cup following a superb run in the qualifiers before suffering an agonising exit with Windies sneaking through.<br/><br/>&quot;Grant Bradburn's departure is a demonstration of the high profile the Scotland men's team has achieved through its continued success over recent years,&quot; Cricket Scotland CEO Malcolm Cannon said.<br/><br/>&quot;Grant leaves the team in a very good position to qualify for, and compete strongly in, the next two World T20 finals in 2020 and 2022. Excellent systems consistently win matches and we now have not only a strong squad and a healthy pathway, but strong systems and a great support team in place. To us, Grant will always be considered a Scot and we wish him the very best of luck and good fortune in his new role as we each move onto a more exciting future.&quot;<br/><br/>Bradburn believes the team is in the right shape to continue their climb in international cricket to eventually one day obtain full membership status. &quot;I am extremely proud of the progress the National Team and Cricket Scotland as an organisation have made, which makes it a difficult decision to step away at this time,&quot; Bradburn said. &quot;The team is in a great place and recent success is no surprise, considering the strong hard working, winning culture that exists amongst the players and staff,&quot; he added before expressing his excitement in being part of the coaching staff of a leading full member nation.<br/><br/>&quot;It is a great honour to be joining Pakistan Cricket Team and their high-quality coaching staff. I have seen the progress that has been made under Mickey Arthur and the opportunity to work with a leading full member team on the rise in world cricket, is a real privilege. Against Scotland in June, we saw the impressive changes that have been instilled, noticeably with the physical stature and fielding abilities of Pakistan's players. I look forward to adding my experience to the players and staff, while being an integral part of the exciting and dominant team, Team Pakistan is becoming&quot;.</span>
