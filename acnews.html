<button class="collapsible">Kohli's Asia Cup absence is an advantage - Hasan Ali</button>

<div class="content">
  <p>The cricketing ties between India and Pakistan are at an all-time low. They rarely play each other and the situation is further aggravated by an ongoing legal dispute between the PCB and the BCCI. So, every Indo-Pak contest, weeks before its scheduled date, starts to make headlines. Such is the anticipation that the only thing the players and team management are asked is about that one particular match.

It was the case when Hasan Ali fronted the media during a training camp for the upcoming Asia Cup. Almost every question, one way or the other, was about the big contest on September 19. Since thrashing India in the ICC Champions Trophy Final over a year ago, this will be the first instance the two teams will come face to face.

"We are on top right now and they [India] will be under pressure from the previous defeat," said Hasan while speaking to reporters. "In UAE, these are our conditions, we have the home advantage as we have been playing here for long and very much aware how to use the conditions well. There is definitely a pressure but I feel good when pressure mounts on me because that is where I try to perform and help my side win."

Hasan picked up the wickets of MS Dhoni, Ravichandran Ashwin, and Jasprit Bumrah - the last wicket of the match - while conceding only 19 runs in 6.3 overs in the final. He was the best bowler of the tournament with 13 wickets - four more than the second highest wicket-taker Josh Hazlewood - at an average of 14.69. What stands out is the fact that he has been the most successful ODI bowler for Pakistan since his debut against Ireland in August 2016. He has taken 68 wickets in 33 matches at a strike-rate of 24, which is the highest for any Pakistan bowler to have taken more than 20 wickets in this span.

Upon becoming the number one ODI bowler last year, Hasan had expressed his desire to bowl to Virat Kohli. But with the BCCI resting the skipper for the tournament, the move has given Pakistan an advantage, according to the Pakistan pacer. "Kohli is a very good player. We all know he is match winner," he said.

"Though India are still a good side, his absence is going to be an advantage for us. He can drive his team out of pressure anytime and any newcomer won't be good enough to handle the pressure. I am definitely going to miss bowling at him. It's natural that every young bower would like to have his wicket.

"But it's okay if he is not coming ... I will look for him the next time. I wasn't targeting Kohli only. We are not going to play only against India as there are other teams [in the tournament] as well. Our main focus is the entire tournament rather than winning one game and losing others. We have do well to beat every team and try to win the tournament."

Since Pakistan have a higher benchmark for the yo-yo test than India, there have been comparisons between the fitness levels of Hasan and Kohli on social media. And, recently, there were rumours that he wishes to keep himself away from the longer version of cricket to focus more on the white ball game to cut on the burden. He, however, struck down the notion.

"People might be comparing my fitness results with Kohli, but he is fitter anyway," he pointed out. "He is a world class player, he is our senior and a legend. There is nothing like I am competing with him, but I have enhanced my focus to be fitter which is anyway required for me. As a youngster you have to look after yourself properly and keep yourself fit. I want to play Test cricket and that's my ambition. Similarly like my T20I and ODI performance, I want to carry on my good work in Tests as well and with my fitness, I can go long way with it."

<button class="collapsible">Every team is a threat in this Asia Cup - Mortaza</button>

<div class="content">
  <p>angladesh skipper Mashrafe Mortaza said on Thursday (September 6) that they are not thinking too far ahead and concentrating on the opening game of the Asia Cup.

Bangladesh could not win the Asia Cup despite playing the finals on two occasions during last three editions of the tournament and that clearly gives them an edge as far as their chances are concerned. But the new format, which sees the addition of two more teams in the Asia Cup apart from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, leaves them at risk of being eliminated from the opening stage where they are placed in group B along with Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.

Two teams from each group will advance to second round known as Super Four in the tournament and that looks to be the primary goal for Bangladesh.

''I think every team is a threat for us,'' Mashrafe told reporters in the official pre-match press conference on Thursday as Bangladesh concluded their preparation for the multi-team competition.

''If you look at the bowling strength of Afghanistan and all-round potency of the Sri Lankans, anything can happen. So for us the opening game is the most important,'' he said. "If we can do well in the opening game we have a chance to progress further in the tournament."

Mashrafe said that he is emphasizing on the opening game more because he is well aware how Afghanistan dominated them in the three-match Twenty20 series at Dehradhun where they clinched the series by 3-0 margin.

Though the format is different, the ghosts of Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman looked very much alive at the back of Mashrafe's mind that prompts him to believe that the best way to go against Afghanistan is by carrying a winning momentum.

''If we can win the opening match we are sure it will help us to handle Rashid and Mujeeb much better,'' said Mashrafe.

''But if don't do well in the opening game it will be even twice the more difficult to beat them so the first game will set the tone for us,'' he said.

However, new head coach Steve Rhodes differs a bit when it comes to handling the spinners of Afghanistan. "I don't think there's a fear factor [as far as spinner are concerned],'' said Rhodes. "We have finger spinners as role models in Shakib and Mehidy. As soon as we have wrist spinners as role models, then the youngsters then may start doing it in the streets.

"We brought Likhon and Tanbir in the nets. Rishad is in the U19s. We have tried to include some legspinners so that our batsmen get some practice,'' he added. I think we should respect Afghanistan. Some quality cricketers play for Afghanistan. They will be respectful of our cricketers too, even though they beat us in the T20s. It will be a really good contest.

''Afghanistan are a tough team. The T20 is their better format. We are not going to take that game lightly, at all. We have to be on top of our game against them and Sri Lanka,'' Rhodes said.

Rhodes added that they are carrying a good confidence going into the Asia Cup after their ODI and T20 series win against West Indies after their disastrous showdown in the Test series earlier.

"I think it would be a wonderful achievement for us to win the Asia Cup. We are going there full of confidence. We are ranked higher than the West Indies but those were still tough games. Winning there gave the team a lot of confidence.

''We have two games to qualify, which is the most important thing. We shouldn't assume that we will get into the next group. We play well against Sri Lanka and Afghanistan, then it will add to the confidence. Then if we are in the last stages of the tournament, why wouldn't you believe that you could win,'' he argued.

Rhodes on the same note added that he is well aware of the expectations and doesn't want to sound too confident regarding their chances in the Asia Cup.

"If I was looking at a crystal ball, I could have told you that we have won the Asia Cup. But I don't have it. There are other mighty teams in Asia - India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. We believe we can. If we try our best, give the 100 per cent, and play some good cricket and believe we can win,'' he concluded.

<button class="collapsible">Liton's chance to seize the opening spot beside Tamim</button>

<div class="content">
  <p>Bangladesh batsman Liton Kumar Das is looking forward to seize the opening spot and cement his place across formats as he prepares for the Asia Cup.

Liton, considered to be one of the most talented batsman in Bangladesh now, is yet to showcase his talent in full scale despite being in the team for quite some time. He has remained out of contention for the opening spot in ODIs since October 2017 after that debacle in South Africa but somehow managed to keep his place in Test and T20Is.

The match-winning knock in the third and final T20I against the Windies coupled by Anamul Haque's prolonged lean patch prompted the management to provide the dashing right-hander with an opportunity in the upcoming Asia Cup tournament, scheduled to be played in UAE from September 15.

''This is actually a good opportunity. I have been out of the ODI team for a long time and If I get a chance then I will try to do well,'' Liton told reporters at Mirpur on Wednesday.

''Being regular [in the team] means something different but nothing can be better that performing well,'' he said. ''We have two matches in the Asia Cup ahead of us and they are very important."

The return of Liton Das in the shorter format was largely due to the repeated failure of Soumya Sarkar at the top and he managed to grab the opportunity with both hands in the final of three-match T20I series against the Windies. Liton fired a 31-ball 62 to help Bangladesh clinch the series by 19 runs through the Duckworth-Lewis method in Lauderhill.

Liton's innings consisted of a flurry of shots, which is believed to the reason why he was picked, but it also puts a question mark regarding his role in the team given Tamim is said to be playing the anchor role. Whether trying to play this over-aggressive brand of cricket suits his style is yet to be determined, but according to Liton he is ready to continue playing attacking brand of cricket as that is the way he prefers to bat and not because he is trying to cover for the slow start from the other end.

''Besides staying at the crease, you have to score runs as well. And if you want to score runs, you'll have to play some shots,'' said Liton. ''Different types of batsmen play differently I like to play aggressively and I will continue this way."

Liton has often been carried away after doing the hard work and it's high time for him to shed the self doubt and translate his potential into performances in the middle.

"Only one ball is enough to get out and I'm working on perfecting my shots,'' said Liton, adding candidly that he is yet to reach a stage where he can consistently translate his starts into a substantial score.

''The big cricketers play big innings if they can start well. I haven't become a big cricketer yet, maybe that's the reason I am not being able to play big innings. I am trying to do something good, so that I can make my innings bigger,'' he concluded.

<button class="collapsible">Kohli rested, Rohit to lead in Asia Cup</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Rohit Sharma will lead the Indian team during the Asia Cup 2018 with regular skipper Virat Kohli being rested from the 16-member squad for the upcoming tournament. Manish Pandey, Ambati Rayudu and Kedar Jadhav have been recalled to the squad while Suresh Raina, Umesh Yadav and Siddarth Kaul, who all featured in the ODI squad on England tour, are among the ones to miss out.

"He has been playing for quite sometime and looking at the workload we have given him [Kohli] the rest," said MSK Prasad, chairman of the senior selection panel. "I would like to say that I was there for the third Test match and we sat for a discussion about the workload management. We need to preserve our precious players who play all three formats and looking at that workload issue we decided to rest him for the Asia Cup.Pandey, who was excluded from the squad for the ODI series against England, forced his way back into the team after a strong showing in List A cricket. He was the highest run-scorer in the recent quadrangular series which featured 'A' teams from South Africa and Australia along with India A and India B. He led from the front in India B's victorious campaign, scoring 306 runs in four games with one hundred and two fifties, and remained unbeaten throughout.

Rayudu, who had been withdrawn from the squad for the ODI series against England due to a failed yo-yo test, recently featured in the quadrangular series along with Jadhav, who returned to active cricket after a lengthy lay-off owing to a hamstring injury he suffered during the first match of IPL 2018. While Rayudu managed a couple of half-centuries and a knock of 48 in four games to finish as the third highest run-getter, Jadhav could only manage 30 runs in three innings.

The return of Pandey, Rayudu and Jadhav signals another round of musical chairs when it comes to middle-order positions, especially the No. 4 slot. When asked if these inclusions puts Raina out of contention, Prasad said: "We have quite a few games coming up [to audition] for that slot, you know. That's definitely one of the slots that we're looking at. We've been trying different options and in those options we have given opportunity to Manish and Rayudu this time."

The squad announced on Saturday (September 1) includes Khaleel Ahmed who has earned his maiden India call-up. A 20-year-old left-arm pacer from Rajasthan, Khaleel was part of the Sunrisers Hyderabad team during the 2018 edition of the IPL but got to play only one game in which he went wicketless while conceding 38 runs off three overs. The left-armer, however, has come up with good performances in recent months, picking up seven wickets for India A in the quadrangular series to finish as the joint third highest wicket-taker. He also did well in the 'A' team tri-series in England, picking up six wickets in three games including a three-wicket haul in the final against England Lions.

"We are closing in on those core group of players around whom the places will be revolving around here on till the World Cup. We have already closed down on that. Two-three slots we are yet to finalise. So for those slots, we will be looking at these 24 matches (coming up before the World Cup). Among that a seamer's slot is available and we are looking at a left-handed option in Khaleel," said Prasad.

Meanwhile, the wait continues for Mayank Agarwal despite his rich vein of form. Agarwal was the second highest run-getter in the quadrangular series, finishing with 236 runs in four games at an average of 59, with one hundred and a fifty. He was India A's highest run-getter, and the second highest overall, in the tri-series in England, scoring 287 runs in four games at an average of 71.75, including two hundreds. The 27-year-old opening batsman from Karnataka had also scored 220 against South Africa A in the four-day match at the Chinnaswamy stadium.

Prasad noted that Mayank "is just a step away" from earning his maiden India call-up. "Mayank has been fantastic and has been performing consistently in the last 10-12 months time. He is just a step way and I'm sure in due course I'm sure he will get his recognition. He did well in all three formats in whatever opportunites he got in domestic cricket and for India A. We will definitely look at him when we rest some of those senior cricketers," Prasad said.

In the bowling department, Jasprit Bumrah returns to the ODI set-up after missing the 50-over games against England due to a thumb injury he sustained during the first T20I against Ireland. The pacer was forced to miss second T20I against Ireland and the subsequent limited-overs series against England before he returned to the Indian team for the third Test. Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who has been recovering from a back injury, also features in the squad, having recently played in the 50-over game against South Africa A in which he picked up three wickets.

India's Asia Cup campaign kicks off on September 18 with a game against the team that wins the Qualifiers. They play their second game the very next day against arch-rivals Pakistan and should they finish among the top two sides from their group, they will make it to the Super four stage with starts from September 21 while the final will be held on September 28.</p>
