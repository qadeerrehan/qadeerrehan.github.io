</div>
</div></div><span class="textstyle4"><br/>As Shoaib Malik will return to Pakistan for a training camp ahead of the Asia Cup, Chris Green will continue to be with Guyana Amazon Warriors' set-up for the remainder of the Caribbean Premier League season. Initially, Green was picked as a cover for the South African batsman Cameron Delport, who in turn had made himself unavailable until August 17.<br/><br/>Green, who plays for Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash League, has put up impressive performances for Amazon Warriors in this year's CPL. With his off-spin, the all rounder has bagged five scalps at an economy rate of just 6.5. He also compiled a crucial unbeaten hand of 25 against St Kitts and Nevis Patriots.<br/><br/>The Amazon Warriors are placed fourth in the standings with three wins from five games.</span>  </div>
