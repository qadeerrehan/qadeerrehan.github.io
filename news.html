Fifty from Ross Taylor along with a couple of 40s from Kennar Lewis and Glenn Phillips set up the win against St Kitts and Nevis Patriots at Sabina Park on Thursday (August 16).<br/><br/>Sent into bat, Tallawahs promoted Lewis to open the innings and the move paid dividends as he got them off the blocks quickly - smashing a six and a couple of fours in the second over itself. By the time the powerplay came to an end, Lewis had raced to 43 and the 50-run opening stand had come up.<br/><br/>However, he didn't last long as Nepal leg-spinner Sandeep Lamichhane dismissed him in the seventh over and soon followed up by trapping Andy McCarthy for a golden duck. The Patriots were back in the game via that over.<br/><br/>Phillips, who had been a spectator till then took up the mantle along with fellow countryman Ross Taylor. The duo steadied the innings with singles and twos before the left-hander unleashed himself on Anton Devcich and Ben Cutting - striking three sixes in two overs to bring up the 100.<br/><br/>But a quiet couple of overs from Carlos Brathwaite and Lamichhane bottled the pressure and Cutting bore the rewards with the wicket of Phillips. Taylor then got into his elements and bludgeoned a couple of sixes off Sheldon Cottrell in the 16th over, followed it up with a couple of fours and a six in Cottrell's next. He brought up his fourth CPL fifty in the final over and Tallawahs ended with 178.<br/><br/>The chase depended on the opening pair of Chris Gayle and Evin Lewis. However, with the veteran's watchful approach at the start of the innings, where he played out a maiden off Krishmar Santokie, put pressure on Lewis and he perished without troubling the scorers.<br/><br/>With Gayle being on 1 off 15 after the first three overs, the pressure was on the other batsmen to up the ante and they were failing - Tom Cooper dismissed by Santokie. Finally, Gayle woke up and struck two sixes in one Oshane Thomas over, but soon departed to Steven Jacobs' off-break.<br/><br/>Patriots could not get going at all and lost three wickets in as many overs from 9th to 11th; Devcich, Devon Thomas and Cutting the batsmen dismissed. Mahmudullah and Brathwaite carried the hopes of Patriots, but when the duo were removed by Zampa and Imad Wasim in a space of seven balls, the chase folded.<br/><br/>Jeramiah Louis hung in and remained unbeaten, while Cottrell swung his bat around and reduced the margin of defeat a bit.<br/><br/>Brief scores: Jamaica Tallawahs 178/4 in 20 overs (Ross Taylor 51*, Kennar Lewis 49, Glenn Phillips 41, Sandeep Lamichhane 2/21) beat St Kitts and Nevis Patriots 131/9 in 20 overs (Chris Gayle 24, Krishmar Santokie 2/13, Imad Wasim 2/21) by 47 runs.</span>  </div>
