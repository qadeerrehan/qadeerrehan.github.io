</div></div><span class="textstyle4"><br/>Some sensational hitting by Darren Bravo backed by Brendon McCullum's panache helped Trinbago Knight Riders seal a comfortable five-wicket win over St Lucia Stars at the Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, on Thursday (August 16). Set 213 to win, Knight Riders had fallen behind in the chase before Bravo and McCullum scored 137 off 54 to help the team storm back in the contest.<br/><br/>In the tall chase, Knight Riders were dented early as they lost Sunil Narine and Chris Lynn with just 20 on the board. Colin Munro got a start but failed to get going and the team found themselves needing 138 in the last ten overs. While McCullum was well set then, Bravo had just walked in and was looking to find his groove.<br/><br/>The revival of the innings started pretty late, only in the 16th over with 84 more needed. Bravo took on Kieran Pollard and smashed five sixes to collect 32 runs off the over and raced past his half-century. McCullum too joined in and picked up 21 from the next over bowled by Obed McCoy to leave the equation down to 32 off 18.<br/><br/>Stars still had a chance by then but it all came crashing down as Rahkeem Cornwall crumbled under pressure and conceded 25 to leave Knight Riders needing just five. Bravo swung hard to get to his century but failed to connect and had to settle for 94 off 36 while McCullum was eventually dismissed for a 42-ball 68.<br/><br/>Earlier, a troika of half-centuries from David Warner, Cornwall and Pollard lifted the side to a challenging total after they were put in. They got off to a brisk start with 49 coming for the opening-wicket stand inside the powerplay. Cornwall and Warner strung together a stand of 79 while the pair of Pollard and Warner had a partnership of 84 to lift the side over the 200-run mark.<br/><br/>Even a good batting performance wasn't enough to help the team end their losing streak as Stars slipped to their fourth loss this season. The side has now lost 15 matches in a row in the history of the CPL.<br/><br/>Brief scores: St Lucia Stars 212/2 in 20 overs (David Warner 72*, Kieran Pollard 63*) lost to Trinbago Knight Riders 218/5 in 20 overs (Darren Bravo 94*, Brendon McCullum 68) by five wickets.</span>  </div>
