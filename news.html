Brazil are the first finalists of the 2019 Copa America thanks to a 2-0 win over Argentina in a spectacular semifinal at the Mineir&#227;o. A match filled with intensity and good football saw a marvelous performance from former Barcelona star Dani Alves, and he&#8217;s going to the Maracan&#227; alongside current Blaugrana players Arthur and Philippe Coutinho who both started and played 90 very good minutes.<br/><br/>As for Lionel Messi, he sang his country&#8217;s national anthem, he tried as hard as he could, he hit the post, he was vocal and made some good plays, but once again his journey in a tournament ends without a trophy for Argentina. The horror movie continues.<br/><br/></span>
  <span class="textstyle3">FIRST HALF</span>
  <span class="textstyle4"><br/><br/>Argentina started the game with possession while Brazil tried to close spaces and create on the counter, and both teams cancelled each other out in the beginning. The in the Sele&#231;&#227;o&#8217;s first real opportunity of the half they got a goal after a sensational individual move by Dani Alves and a beautiful assist from Firmino to Gabriel Jesus for the opener.<br/><br/>The Albiceleste were not affected by the goal and continued to attack, with Messi playing as a central midfielder looking to link up with the two strikers and create from there. The plan worked as Argentina made some good moves through the middle and won a few free-kicks, which nearly gave them the equalizer with an Ag&#252;ero header against the crossbar.<br/><br/>The final minutes of the half were filled with arguments and some hard fouls, and the referee had to control the nerves with a few harsh yet necessary bookings. At halftime, Brazil had the lead but Argentina were bringing the fight, and we were set for an amazing second half.<br/><br/></span>
  <span class="textstyle3">SECOND HALF</span>
  <span class="textstyle4"><br/><br/>Argentina continued to attack and press high up the pitch looking for chances, and they got a huge one when Lautaro had his shot block but the ball fell to Messi, who hit the post and nearly scored on the rebound. Messi had another chance on a beautiful free kick that was brilliantly stopped by Alisson, and Leo started to really put his stamp on the game as his team looked for an equalizer.<br/><br/>Then Argentina lost the ball in the final thrid with plenty of bodies forward, Gabriel Jesus started a counter attack by himself with an incredible solo run, put both Otamendi and Foyth on the ground and gave Firmino a tap-in and Brazil&#8217;s second on the night. Argentina lacked ideas in the end and couldn&#8217;t find a goal to stay alive, and the final whistle came.<br/><br/>Arthur and Coutinho are going to the Maracan&#227;, and Messi is out again. This is surely it, right?<br/><br/>Brazil: Alisson; Alves, Marquinhos (Miranda), Silva, Sandro, Arthur, Casemiro; Jesus (Allan), Coutinho, Everton (Willian); Firmino<br/><br/>Goals: Jesus (19&#8217;), Fimino (71&#8217;)<br/><br/>Argentina: Armani; Foyth, Pezzella, Otamendi, Tagliafico (Dybala); De Paul (Lo Celso), Paredes, Acu&#241;a (Di Mar&#237;a); Messi; Lautaro, Ag&#252;ero<br/><br/>Goals: None</span>
