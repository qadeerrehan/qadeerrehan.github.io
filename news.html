He last featured in the league in 2013 playing for Antigua Hawksbills.<br/><br/>Smith, who is currently serving a one-year ban imposed by Cricket Australia (CA) for his involvement in the ball-tampering saga in the Cape Town Test, returned to cricket with the Toronto Nationals in the recently concluded Global T20 Canada.<br/><br/>Smith, who has scored 3124 runs in T20 cricket, including a hundred and 11 fifties, will replace Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan who is no longer available for the tournament.<br/><br/>Speaking about their new signing, Tridents coach Robin Singh said: It is a huge blow to lose Shakib for the tournament but in Steve Smith we have a truly world-class replacement who can help to bring power to our batting line-up. As a man who has played cricket at the highest level all over the world we are very confident that Smith will be a big success with the Tridents.&quot;<br/><br/>Meanwhile, St Lucia Stars confirmed earlier that David Warner, who is also facing a 12-month ban, will make his CPL debut this season. Warner was named as a replacement to D'Arcy Short, who will not be able to part take in the T20 tournament as he is part of the Australia A squad that tours India for a quadrangular series.<br/><br/>The CA ban does not restrict both from playing overseas leagues or lower-grade cricket.</span>
