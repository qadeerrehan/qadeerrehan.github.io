He also missed the following two-match Test series and two T20Is against Sri Lanka before joining the squad halfway through the Nidahas Trophy in March.<br/><br/>Bangladesh Cricket Board is likely to take a decision soon on when to ask Shakib to get his finger operated. If they do ask him to go under the knife on an immediate basis, he will miss the Asia Cup.<br/><br/>&quot;I have to do a surgery. So the discussion now is about when to do it. I want it to happen as soon as possible. It will most probably be before the Asia Cup,&quot; Shakib told reporters at Hazrat International Airport upon his arrival from the recently concluded tour of the West Indies.<br/><br/>Shakib expressed delight with the way his team fought back in the limited-over series after being thrashed in the two Tests, and believes the confidence gained from the win will leave the team in good stead for their Asia Cup campaign.<br/><br/>&quot;It was quite a satisfying performance,&quot; he said. &quot;We won trophies in two out of the three series. We don't usually play this well abroad. Naturally the confidence is high in the squad. We can (now) start thinking of something new (to achieve).&quot;<br/><br/>Despite a forgetful return to Test cricket from a six-month hiatus, Shakib was among the star performers for Bangladesh in the limited-overs leg - both of which (ODIs and T20Is) were won in the decider clashes. The all-rounder was adjudged the Player of the Series in the three-match T20Is.<br/><br/>&quot;I am happy with how I did but maybe I could have contributed more,&quot; said Shakib, adding that he was not concerned that bulk of the runs were made by the seniors players, while the youngsters shined only in brief passages.<br/><br/>Shakib, along with Tamim Iqbal, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah and Mashrafe Mortaza, scored more than 70 percent of Bangladesh's runs on the West Indies tour. &quot;We (seniors) all bat in the top order, so we get more opportunities to contribute and we should contribute more. As we play at the top, the percentage of contribution is higher,&quot; he added.<br/><br/>&#169; Cricbuzz</span>
